# Day 13 – Database Indexing & Query Optimization

## Overview
This project demonstrates how database indexing improves
query performance in a real Airbnb-style database.

---

## What is Indexing?
An index allows the database to find records faster,
similar to an index in a book.

---

## What Was Done
- Executed slow queries without index
- Added indexes on key columns
- Re-ran queries
- Used EXPLAIN to analyze performance

---

## Files
| File | Purpose |
|------|--------|
before_index.sql | Query before optimization  
create_index.sql | Index creation  
after_index.sql | Optimized query  
explain_queries.sql | Query plan
