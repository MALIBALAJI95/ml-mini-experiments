# Day 08 – Loss Functions (Multi-Language Implementation)

## Overview
This project implements core loss functions used in machine learning
from scratch using Python, Java, and C++.

---

## Why This Project Matters
- Demonstrates ML fundamentals
- Shows cross-language problem solving
- No external ML libraries used
- Placement and interview oriented

---

## Loss Functions Implemented
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Binary Cross Entropy

---

## Languages Used
- Python
- Java
- C++

---

## How to Run

### Python
```bash
python python/test_loss.py
